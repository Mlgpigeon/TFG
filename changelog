Version 0.1
 * @Date 2022/4/21
 The program allows to create dynamically objects from json-stat files from the INE database.
 The URL to get the json-stat file is constructed from a config.yaml file.
 This are the classes of objects that can be created:
  ProcJsonStatDataset contains:
   -Dimensions (JsonStatDimension)
   -Value list
   -Status list
  JsonStatDimension contains:
    -Name
    -Label
    -Category (JsonStatCategory)
    -Role
  JsonStatCategory contains:
    -Index
    -Label
    -Size
  The names of the dimensions are normalized before being generated.

Version 0.2
 * @Date 2022/4/28
 The program's methods are now inside the class IneJsonStat.
 The program now uses a log of two levels: INFO and DEBUG
 The URL is now checked only once only it's parameterized and fails, in which case
  it is shortened to a basic URL and the system retries.
 Minor errors solved
